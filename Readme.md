## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->
Walking is a simple physical activities which can embrace human health and well being. We tend to detect walking movements from daily GPS trajectories.
## Research Questions
<!-- (50-60 words) -->
1. What are compared with other travel modes?
## Results / products
<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? -->

## Data
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->
1. Raw GPS data collected by POSMO Application
2. 
## Analytical concepts
<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

## Questions? 
<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
1. How to match GPS trajectories (raw coordinates) with road segments/network?
2. Can I use machine learning to detect travel modes (random forest, un-supervised)? If so, any recommendations in R packages/modeling?
3.
