abstract = {The rapid development in telecommunication networks is producing a huge amount of information regarding how people (with their mobile devices) move and behave over space and time. While GPS data, typically collected by smartphone apps, are restricted to rather small samples of the population, mobile phone network data, routinely collected by mobile network operators, potentially allow to analyze travel behaviors and social interaction of the whole population, with full temporal (e.g., longitudinal) coverage at a comparatively low cost. Therefore, recent years have seen an increasing interest in using such data for human mobility studies. However, due to their noisy and temporally infrequent/irregular nature, extracting mobility information such as transport modes from these data is particularly challenging. This paper provides an in-depth, systematic review of transport mode detection based on mobile phone network data. The results of the review show that existing studies tend to identify easy-to-detect modes (e.g., train or metro), or aggregate fine-grained modes into more general groups (e.g., public versus private transport). Rule-based methods making use of geographic data were often developed. More importantly, due to the lack of ground truth data, evaluation of the proposed methods was seldom done and reported. Finally, we identify a list of research gaps currently being faced in this field, particularly regarding robust and real-time data cleaning and mode detection methods, “benchmark” datasets and metrics allowing the comparison of different mode detection methods, as well as privacy and bias issues.}

abstract = {Global positioning systems (GPS) tracking data have been widely used to collect mobility data to investigate travel behaviors and identify travel patterns. Some critical travel information, such as frequently visited locations, speeds, temporal changes, can be easily extracted from the raw GPS data. However, travel information like transport modes that have been used are difficult to acquire, and more complex analytical processes are required. Previous studies have mostly adopted context-specific methods or stand-alone methods in detecting transport modes from GPS data. Most of these context-specific methods are based on a limited number of datasets since the required data labeling process is time-consuming. This paper proposes a generic stepwise methodology by integrating unsupervised learning algorithms, GIS multi-criteria process, and supervised learning algorithms for data labeling and transport mode detection. The performances of five commonly used supervised algorithms are evaluated by applying them to a large-scale GPS tracking dataset. The results indicate that the proposed stepwise methodology can reduce data labeling time while providing high precision in detecting transport modes. The evaluation shows that the Random Forest algorithm is the most preferable, with only 10% labeled data needed and it can achieve a precision of 99%.}

ABSTRACT = {GPS trajectories generated by moving objects provide researchers with an excellent resource for revealing patterns of human activities. Relevant research based on GPS trajectories includes the fields of location-based services, transportation science, and urban studies among others. Research relating to how to obtain GPS data (e.g., GPS data acquisition, GPS data processing) is receiving significant attention because of the availability of GPS data collecting platforms. One such problem is the GPS data classification based on transportation mode. The challenge of classifying trajectories by transportation mode has approached detecting different modes of movement through the application of several strategies. From a GPS data acquisition point of view, this paper macroscopically classifies the transportation mode of GPS data into single-mode and mixed-mode. That means GPS trajectories collected based on one type of transportation mode are regarded as single-mode data; otherwise it is considered as mixed-mode data. The one big difference of classification strategy between single-mode and mixed-mode GPS data is whether we need to recognize the transition points or activity episodes first. Based on this, we systematically review existing classification methods for single-mode and mixed-mode GPS data and introduce the contributions of these methods as well as discuss their unresolved issues to provide directions for future studies in this field. Based on this review and the transportation application at hand, researchers can select the most appropriate method and endeavor to improve them.},

abstract = {Over the past couple of decades, there has been an exponential increase in the collection of large-scale GPS data from household/personal travel surveys all over the world. A range of algorithms, which vary from specific rules to advanced machine learning methods, have been applied to extract travel modes from raw GPS data collected by smartphone-based travel surveys. However, most of the methods applied neither describe the interaction between features influencing the travel mode decision nor effectively deal with the ambiguity inherently incorporated in these features. This paper identifies travel modes with a Bayesian network, whose structure is established based on a K2 algorithm and corresponding conditional probability tables are estimated with maximum likelihood methods. Five representative travel modes – walk, bike, e-bike, bus and car – are distinguished using the resulting Bayesian network. Additionally, the low speed rate and the average heading change are introduced to reduce uncertainties between bike and e-bike segments and between bus and car segments. The derived travel modes are then compared with those retrieved in the prompted recall survey by telephones. Consequently, more than 86% of segments have the travel mode correctly identified for each travel mode, with over 97% of walk segments being properly flagged. Results from the study demonstrate that GPS travel surveys provide an opportunity to supplement traditional travel surveys.}

abstract = {A map-matching algorithm is used to map the inaccurate raw coordinate data to the digital road network. It is an indispensable part of Location Based Service applications and Intelligent Transportation Systems, such as navigation systems. Accuracy and performance (running speed) are usually traded off in traditional algorithms. An enhanced weight-based real-time map matching algorithm only employing GPS data is proposed to guarantee both. The algorithm has two steps: initialization and tracking match, each step is mainly composed of three parts. Firstly, segments near the GPS point are selected as candidate segments. Secondly, four criteria (distance, heading difference, direction difference and segment connectivity) are used to identify the best segment among candidates. Considering the reliability of each criterion, four dynamic weight coefficients are introduced. Finally, before assigning a candidate segment to each GPS point, a confidence level is calculated and considered based on the density and complexity of roads around the point. We evaluate the algorithm with field data collected from the city of Chongqing, China. The results demonstrate that it can identify correct segment from complicated and dense urban road networks, with an average matching accuracy of 97.31% and a latency of 3.20ms per location estimate.}

abstract = {An abundance of GPS data on walking and cycling requires substantial data processing – a primary component of which is trip identification to distinguish between data recorded during travel versus activities. The objective of this paper is to systematically evaluate trip identification algorithms in the literature and provide recommendations to improve performance for walking and cycling trips. Fourteen algorithms are applied to 1685 GPS trajectories from Vancouver, Canada, and evaluated on the bases of their agreement, distinction of trip and activity data characteristics, processing time, and accuracy (based on a labeled subset). Error sources are identified in relationship to trajectory, network, and weather factors. Results indicate poor concordance and widely varying performance, with no algorithm best across all measures. Four high-performing algorithms are identified with at least 90% record-level accuracy; other considerations include accuracy of the inferred number and duration of trips, precision of identified trip end points, and computational resource requirements. Density is a key variable for trip identification in the best-performing algorithms. Proximity to tree canopy, buildings, bridges, and tunnels affects the accuracy of some algorithms more than others. Most algorithms err almost entirely with false trips or false activities, which is a bias of concern for analysis. The importance of trip identification decisions should motivate more thorough reporting to enhance reproducibility and reliability.}
